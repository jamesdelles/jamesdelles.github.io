## Welcome to James Delles's homepage

I'm learning to code. I built my first website in the 90s on geocities and have been a bit of a tinkerer ever since. 

On this site, I'll share the resources I'm using, any projects I've put together, and my thoughts. It is my site afterall. 

### Resources
-----

-[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/jamesdelles) Free basic courses. It seems to jump from copy/paste simple coding examples to complex with not much bridge in between. There is a pro version which I will be trying soon as well as tailored "learning paths." I'm working on the data science path now. 

-[Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/jamesdelles) I used this site for a while back in 2016 before life got crazy. 

-[GitHub](https://github.com/jamesdelles) This is virtually brand new for me. I've tried to learn it before, but fell short. This time I'm doing it! This site is built with a unique [markdown code](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), reminds me a bit of old BBcode. 

### Projects
-----

None yet. Stay tuned. Unless you count my [hello-world](https://github.com/jamesdelles/hello-world)... and you know what, it counts. :)

### Thoughts
-----

I have extensive thoughts on education, specifically adult education with respect to keeping tech skills sharp. I'll be adding those soon. But I'd also love to hear from you. Feel free to connect with me here, on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesdelles/), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/jamesdelles), or send an [email](mailto:james.delles@gmail.com).
